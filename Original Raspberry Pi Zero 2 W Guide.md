# Prerequisites for Setting Up Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

## Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**  
    The main computing device.
    ![[Pasted image 20250614230829.png]]
    
- **MicroSD Card**  
    Any capacity is acceptable; however, it is recommended to use a high-capacity and high-speed (Class 10 or UHS-I/UHS-II) MicroSD card for optimal performance and reliability.
    **Recommended:** Use the official Raspberry Pi-branded MicroSD card. Unlike general-purpose SD cards designed primarily for data storage, the Raspberry Pi SD card is optimized for running operating systems and handling frequent read/write cycles, offering better durability and performance specifically for Raspberry Pi use cases.
                                   ![[images.jpg]]
    
    
- **MicroSD Card Reader**  
    A modern, high-speed card reader is preferred to reduce errors and speed up the process of writing the OS image to the MicroSD card.
                           ![[51Z9vr9xWnL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg]]
    
- **Micro USB Cable (Data & Power Supported) and a Power Brick**  
	    A **Micro USB cable** is required to power the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and optionally enable data communication (e.g., for USB gadget mode). Ensure the cable supports **both power and data**, as many low-quality or charging-only cables lack data lines. 
	    Additionally, use a reliable **5V power adapter** (power brick) capable of supplying at least **2.5A** to ensure stable operation, especially if peripherals are connected.

- **(Optional) Male-to-Male Jumper Wire**  
	Useful for implementing a safe shutdown mechanism for the Raspberry Pi via GPIO. This can be used to physically trigger shutdown scripts or to short specific pins for controlled power-off.
	                         ![[907cd3e4-img_jumper_wire_male_to_male.jpg]]
- **(Optional) Heat Sink**  
	Recommended for thermal management. The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W can become warm under heavy loads, so attaching a small heat sink helps maintain optimal operating temperatures, improving stability and prolonging the lifespan of the device.
	                  ![[aluminium-heat-sink.jpg]]

## Software Requirements 

- **Raspberry Pi Imager** (recommended) or any other disk imaging tool (e.g., Rufus)  
    Used to write the Raspberry Pi OS image onto the MicroSD card.
    
- **Raspberry Pi OS Image**  
    Obtain the latest ISO or image file of the Raspberry Pi OS for installation.

### Step 8: Select Storage Device

Insert the MicroSD card into your computer using a card reader.

- Click **"CHOOSE STORAGE"** in the imager.
    ![[Screenshot 2025-06-14 193548.png]]
- Select the correct storage device (your MicroSD card) from the list.  
    ⚠️ **Double-check** that you've selected the correct drive to avoid overwriting other data.

### Step 9: Customize OS Settings

Click **“Next”** and then choose **“Edit Settings”** when prompted.
![[Pasted image 20250615113925.png]]
#### General Tab:
![[Screenshot 2025-06-14 225715.png]]
- **Set username and password**.
    
- **Configure Wi-Fi**:
    
    - Add your **SSID** and **Wi-Fi password**.
        
    - ⚠️ **Important**: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W supports **2.4GHz Wi-Fi only**.
        
- **Set your time zone** to ensure accurate time logs.
#### Services Tab:

- Enable **SSH**.
    
- Select **“Allow public-key authentication only”** (more secure).
    ![[Pasted image 20250615114626.png]]

##### To add a public SSH key in Windows:

1. Open File Explorer and go to your user folder: `C:\Users\YourUsername\`
    
2. Enable **hidden files**.
    
3. Open the `.ssh` folder.
    
4. Look for a file ending in `.pub`. If none exists:
    
    - Open Command Prompt and run:
        
        ```
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa
        ```
        
    - Press Enter for the next 2–3 prompts.
        ![[Pasted image 20250615114448.png]]
    - This will generate the `.pub` file.
        
5. Open the `.pub` file with Notepad.
    
6. Copy its contents and paste it into the **public key** field in Raspberry Pi Imager.
![[Pasted image 20250615114100.png]]
#### Options Tab:

- Check:
    
    - ✅ Play sound when finished
        
    - ✅ Eject media when finished
        
- Uncheck:
    
    - ❌ Enable telemetry
        

Click **Save** when done.
![[Screenshot 2025-06-14 225816.png]]

---

### Step 10: Confirm and Flash

1. The Imager will ask: "Would you like to apply OS customization settings?"  
    → Click **Yes**.
    
2. Confirm with "Are you sure?"  
    → Click **Yes** again.
    

The flashing process will begin. It may take a few minutes.

- Once complete, you’ll hear a **beep sound** indicating the microSD card is ready to use.

# Booting Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (**headless mode**)

### Step 1: Insert the MicroSD Card

Remove the microSD card from your computer or card reader and insert it into the **microSD slot** on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

### Step 2: Connect the Micro USB Cable

Plug a **Micro USB cable** into one of the Raspberry Pi's Micro USB ports.

> 🔌 **Important:**  
> While either port can be used for power, **only the Micro USB port closest to the Micro HDMI port supports data transfer** (USB OTG).  
> Use this port if you plan to connect peripherals like keyboards, Ethernet adapters, or USB drives.

### Step 3: Power On the Raspberry Pi

Connect the other end of the Micro USB cable to a **5V power adapter** and turn it on.

### Step 4: Wait for Boot

The Raspberry Pi will power up and begin booting from the microSD card.  
This process may take a minute or two on the first boot, especially if you've enabled OS customizations or SSH access.

> 🟢 You can confirm it's running by observing the activity LED on the Pi. If you're using SSH, wait a moment before scanning your network or attempting to log in.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting: Manual Wi-Fi Configuration (if Raspberry Pi Imager Fails)

If your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W does **not connect to Wi-Fi** after flashing with Raspberry Pi Imager — or if the advanced options in Imager didn’t save properly — you can manually configure Wi-Fi using the `wpa_supplicant.conf` method.

This is an alternative (fallback) setup used in **headless mode** (no screen or keyboard):

---

### ✅ Create `wpa_supplicant.conf` File (WPA/WPA2 Networks Only)

In the **boot** partition of the SD card (visible on Windows/macOS), create a new file called:

```
wpa_supplicant.conf
```
![[Pasted image 20250615172859.png]]
Paste the following configuration:

```conf
country=IN
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="YourNetworkSSID"
    psk="YourNetworkPassword"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

> 🔧 **Replace:**
> 
> - `IN` with your two-letter country code (e.g., `US`, `GB`, `DE`)
>     
> - `"YourNetworkSSID"` with your actual Wi-Fi network name
>     
> - `"YourNetworkPassword"` with your Wi-Fi password
>     
![[Screenshot 2025-06-15 172656.png]]
---

### 🔐 Enable SSH Access

In the **same boot partition**, create an **empty file** named:

```
ssh
```

(No file extension, and leave it completely blank.)

This enables SSH on first boot.

---

### 🚀 Boot the Pi and Connect

1. Eject the SD card safely and insert it into the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
    
2. Power on the Pi using a Micro USB cable and a 5V/2.5A power supply.
    
3. Wait about 60–90 seconds for the Pi to boot and connect to the network.
    
4. Then, try connecting via terminal or command prompt:
    

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

> 💡 If `raspberrypi.local` doesn’t work, use your router’s admin panel or a network scanning app (like **Fing** or **Angry IP Scanner**) to find the Pi’s IP address.

---
## 🔄 System Updates

Once you’re connected to your Raspberry Pi via SSH, it’s a good idea to update the system to ensure you have the latest security patches and software improvements.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Update the Package List

```bash
sudo apt update
```

This command fetches the latest list of available software and updates from the Raspberry Pi OS repositories.  
It **does not install** any updates yet.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Upgrade Installed Packages

```bash
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

This installs the newest versions of all installed packages, resolving any dependency changes automatically.  
It’s more thorough than `apt upgrade`.

> 🛡️ **Tip:** The `-y` flag auto-confirms prompts. Omit it if you prefer to review changes before applying.

---

### ✅ Step 3 (Optional): Clean Up Unused Packages

```bash
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

Removes packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer needed, helping free up space.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Reboot (if required)

Some updates (especially kernel or firmware updates) may require a reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Your Raspberry Pi will restart and apply any pending changes.
